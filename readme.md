This is a repository for blockchain school project, utilizing web3.js, metamask, node.js,
handlebars, bootstrap, and mongodb to allow uses to interact with a Solidity smart contract on the
Etherium blockchain!

The site is called "pixeljunkie" and allows users to purchase PixelCoins with Ether, the crytpocurrency of Etherium.

pixeljunkie is a collectible game without much functionality beyond collecting unique pixels of a give picture.

Future implementations of the site will expand on this base.

Please see my [Proposal](proposal.md) for the intentions of this project.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at

Thank you.
